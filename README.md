Here is a video of the sketch you will be making today:

[![Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/PCvHjpE3K1c/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCvHjpE3K1c)

Start by making a new Processing project and save it with the following name D111111_Bryan_Duggan (replace with your student number and name).

What is happening:

The yellow rectangles with the stripes are bees and a new one will spawn every second off the right side of the screen. They move at a random speed of between 2 and 5 pixels each frame towards the left side of the screen. Each bee is 20 pixels high and 50 pixels wide and the number of black stripes indicates the speed it is travelling at. For example if it is travelling at 2 pixels per second, it will have 2 stripes.
The black spray can is drawn at the mouse position. Pressing the mouse button will make the spray can emit a spray which is drawn in white. If the spray hits a bee, the "Bees killed" score goes up. If a bee reaches the left side of the screen, it should no longer be drawn and the Bees escaped score should go up. 

Marking scheme:

| Description | Marks |
|-------------|-------|
| Bee drawing and movement | 30 |
| Can drawing and movement | 20 |
| Can spraying | 20 |
| Spray collisions with the bees | 20 |
| Use of an ArrayList | 10 |

If you can't figure out how to do a part of the test, you should move on and do other parts. You should try to use classes in your solution, but its not essential. 

At the end of the test, zip up your sketch folder making sure it is named correctly and email it to bryan.duggan@dit.ie

*Make sure and save your work regularly*.
